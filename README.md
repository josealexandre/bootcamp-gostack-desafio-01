# bootcamp-gostack-desafio-01

Project developed for the 1st challenge (module 01). [Rocketseat bootcamp course]

The objective was to build an API using Express.js that exposes some endpoints with the CRUD funcionality to store, delete, update and list the user's projects and its tasks.

Middlewares were introduced to count the requests and to check if the record already exists.

The data was asked to be stored in memory for simplification purposes.

### Useful tools:

- **VSCode**: development and debug;
- **Insomnia**: lightweight client app to make HTTP requests to the API;
- **Yarn**: package manager.

### Dependencies:

- **nodemon** [dev]: dev dependency to restart the app when the code is modified.

## How to run:

Use one of the following commands:

```
yarn dev
```

or

```
node index.js
```
